#Lowla Test

Experimenting with TeamStudio's preliminary data-sync framework: Lowla.


###User Requirements

Simple set of user requirements that will allow me to explore the API.

- Generic TODO list app
- User can create TODOs
- User can delete TODOs
- User can update TODOs

Other:

- Can user delete multiple TODOs in batch?
- How many TODOs can a user create and manage at once? Pagination?
- Can we sync data to the server yet?
