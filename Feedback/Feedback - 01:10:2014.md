###Core Data Integration (Suggestion)

- It would be useful if this library integrated with Apple's Core Data somehow.
- RestKit provides [Core Data integration](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit#api-quickstart) that allows you to persist remote objects for offline caching.


###Upsert Support (Note)

- Upsert support is cool


###Aggregation (Limitation)

- I can't query a collection to aggregate the data (e.g. sum, average, etc)

- Would be useful to have some sort of API for doing this. Maybe similar to MongoDB's MapReduce?

- I _think_ NSPredicate has support for aggregate functions.



###Multithreading (Limitation / Question)

- Can I use this library across multiple threads? If so, how?

- Sometimes I want to do read / writes concurrently using a [queue](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/ConcurrencyProgrammingGuide/OperationObjects/OperationObjects.html).

- Would be useful to have some docs around what conventions and patterns I should use when using this concurrently.
