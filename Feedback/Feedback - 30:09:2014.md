###Object Building - Document API (Suggestion)
 
- At the moment I have to build a complex object like this:
	
``` Objective-C

LDBObjectBuilder *contactBuilder = [[LDBObjectBuilder builder] appendString:@"steve.fortune@icecb.com" forField:@"email"];
[contactBuilder appendString:@"Steve" forField:@"first_name"];
[contactBuilder appendString:@"Fortune" forField:@"last_name"];
    
LDBObject *contact = [contactBuilder finish];
    
LDBObjectBuilder *todoBuilder = [[LDBObjectBuilder builder] appendString:@"New TODO" forField:@"title"];
[todoBuilder appendString:@"Make some toast" forField:@"body"];
[todoBuilder appendObject:contact forField:@"contact"];

```

â€¦ Would be useful if I could build a document with nested objects directly from an `NSDictionary` literal. Something like:


``` Objective-C

LDBObject *todo = [[LDBObjectBuilder builder] build:@{
	@"title": @"New TODO",
	@"body": @"Make some toast",
	@"contact": @{
		@"email": @"steve.fortune@icecb.com",
		@"first_name": @"Steve",
		@"last_name": @"Fortune",
	},
	@"created_date": [NSDate date],
	@"associated_todos": @[
		[todo1 objectIdForField:@"_id"],
		[todo2 objectIdForField:@"_id"],
		[todo3 objectIdForField:@"_id"],
		.
		.
	],
}];

```

- Not sure if I should be creating `LDBObject` instances directly. The tests seem to indicate that I should use the `LDBObjectBuilder`.. otherwise I would have called `initWithData` directly?

###Transactions (Suggestion)

- CoreData has a nice persistent API whereby you can insert/update/delete objects in the object graph and then commit all the changes in one go via a `save` call.
- This also allows you to discard changes via `rollback`, and has `undo` / `redo` support via the [Undo Manager](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSUndoManager_Class/Reference/Reference.html)
- Kind of like transactions
- Similar support would be useful in the Lowla API


###No Support for Collection Length (Limitation)*

- I can't seem to query the number of objects in a collection.
- This appears to be problematic when trying to integrate with the `UITableView` using the `UITableViewDataSource` protocol, as this requires that the data source provides the `numberOfRowsInSection`
- Using the `NSFetchedResultsController` it can be achieved via [this](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/Documentation/CoreData/Reference/NSFetchedResultsSectionInfo_Protocol/index.html) protocol.
- Also may also inhibit use with `UICollectionView`, which has a datasource protocol with similar requirements
- I'll continue to look through the Lowla ObjC source to see if I'm missing something
