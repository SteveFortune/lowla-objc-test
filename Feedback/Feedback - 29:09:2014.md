###Cocoa Pod

- [These](https://github.com/lowla/lowladb-objc#installation) instructions didn't work for me.
- Tried a couple of variations:

![Pod - Could Not Install 2](pod_could_not_install_2.png)
![Pod - Could Not Install 1](pod_could_not_install_1.png)

- Could not find the pod via CocoaPods search index:

![Pod - Could Not Find](pod_could_not_find.png =500x)

- Cloned the actual CocoaPods [specs repo](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs) from github and found `liblowladb` but not `lowladb-objc`:

###Disclaimer

These are my immediate note while using the Lowla Obj-C library.

- They may be arbirary or based purely on my opinion. 
- They may already be planned for in the future
- If anything in here is technically incorrect, do let me know !
